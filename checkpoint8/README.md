# Hotel-Booking-Website
This is a project that I got a chance to build from scratch as part of the Upgrad's FSD course. The project is about creating a dynamic website wherein users can search for hotels in a city of their choice and can book a room in that hotel. 
Project is build using the HTML and CSS concepts learned along the course.
